        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: March 11, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using the <strong>Color Picker & Palettes</strong> app (hereinafter referred to as the “App”), developed by individual developer Lepekha Ruslan. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information while using the App. I aim to ensure transparency and safeguard your data in compliance with applicable privacy laws.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
        <p>I may collect the following information:</p>

        <h3>1.1. Data Collected via Firebase Analytics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The App uses Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) for anonymous usage analysis. Collected data includes:</li>
            <li>Device type, operating system, and version.</li>
            <li>Anonymous interaction data with the App (e.g., number of sessions, duration of use, features you access).</li>
            <li>IP address (anonymized).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is not linked to your personally identifiable information (e.g., name or email) and is used solely to improve the App’s functionality.</p>

        <h3>1.2. User-Generated Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The App allows you to create publicly accessible links to color palettes you generate. These links may be accessible to other users if you choose to share them. I do not store personal information associated with these links, but I recommend not including confidential data in your palettes.</li>
            <li>Color names in the App are approximate and intended for general use only. They are not precise and should not be used in professional or critical situations requiring high accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3. Data I Do Not Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not collect your personal information, such as name, address, phone number, or email, unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via a contact form if added later).</li>
            <li>The App does not require account login and does not store your photos or images on my servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How I Use Collected Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: Data is used to analyze usage trends, troubleshoot issues, and enhance the user experience. This data is not disclosed to third parties except Google as the Firebase provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Publicly Accessible Links</strong>: Links to palettes are created for your convenience to share, and I do not control how other users use them after creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Names</strong>: Approximate color information is provided for inspiration and creative projects only and does not guarantee accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties, except as required by law or necessary to provide services (e.g., data sharing with Google for Firebase Analytics).</li>
            <li>In the event of a sale, acquisition, or cessation of my development activities, your information may be transferred to a new owner, subject to compliance with this Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I take reasonable measures to protect collected data but cannot guarantee absolute security due to the nature of the Internet. Anonymized data collected via Firebase is encrypted according to Google’s standards.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for the security of your publicly accessible links. Do not share them with untrusted individuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You may contact me to request the deletion of any data I may have collected, though most data is anonymous and not personally linked to you. Please note that data contained in created publicly accessible palette links cannot be deleted, as they are part of public content.</li>
            <li>If you reside in a region with applicable laws (e.g., the European Union), you may have additional rights to access, correct, or delete data (except for data in public links). Contact me at <a href="mailto:ruslan.lepekha@gmail.com">ruslan.lepekha@gmail.com</a> to exercise these rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Policy from time to time. Changes will be published here with the new update date. I recommend periodically reviewing this document.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact me at: <a href="mailto:ruslan.lepekha@gmail.com">ruslan.lepekha@gmail.com</a> or through the support section in the App.</p>
